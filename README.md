# OBA Application

This repository contains our voice assistant application built for the [OBA (Amsterdam Public Library)](https://www.oba.nl/). It's a voice guided assistant to help parents in the Netherlands with reading to their children when they don't speak Dutch as their first language. Since it's important in language development for parents to read to their children, we are hoping to make a difference here.

## Current status

This first prototype goes as far as guiding parents and children through the first two pages of the child`s book "Brieven van Beer." This can now be used by the designers to bring to their test subjects to provide feedback for possible further development.

## Usage

To use this prototype, it's possible to download these files as a `.zip` file, log in to [dialogflow.com](https://dialogflow.com/) and import that for yourself. Another way to just view our working application is to provide us with your mailaddress so we can give you review privileges for our own testing environment. You will then be able to use our agent in your own google assistant application for that mailaddress. Keep in mind the agent will only work when Dutch is defined as your default language.
