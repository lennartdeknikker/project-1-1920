# OBA Application
This repository contains our voice assistant application built for the [OBA (Amsterdam Public Library)](https://www.oba.nl/). It's a voice guided assistant to help parents in the Netherlands with reading to their children when they don't speak Dutch as their first language. Since it's important in language development for parents to read to their children, we are hoping to make a difference here.

## Current status
This first prototype goes as far as guiding parents and children through the first two pages of the child`s book "Brieven van Beer." This can now be used by the designers to bring to their test subjects to provide feedback for possible further development.

## Usage
To use this prototype, it's possible to download these files as a `.zip` file, log in to [dialogflow.com](https://dialogflow.com/) and import that for yourself. Another way to just view our working application is to provide us with your mailaddress so we can give you review privileges for our own testing environment. You will then be able to use our agent in your own google assistant application for that mailaddress. Keep in mind the agent will only work when Dutch is defined as your default language.

We'll look into it and add you as a viewer to the project.

## Privacy regulations Google
More information can be found in their [Privacy notice for childrens features](https://assistant.google.com/privacy-notice-childrens-features/)

Before releasing an application like this and having it available to download or use from the Google Assistant you would have to agree to the [U.S. Childrenâ€™s Online Privacy and Protection Act (COPPA)](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/privacy-and-security/children's-privacy). As well as the [E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679).
Google also has their own rules in place with their For Families program which sets some [requirements](https://developers.google.com/assistant/console/policies/general-policies#actions_for_families) next to also agreeing with their regular [Terms of Service](https://developers.google.com/assistant/console/policies/terms-of-service) and [addendum](https://developers.google.com/assistant/console/policies/actions-for-families-addendum) for the For Families program.
So it's definitely not easy releasing something on that platform thanks to Google's own Terms of Service, United States and European Union laws and regulations (next to also agreeing to not breaking any rule or law within your own country or any country you're in or releasing in.).
